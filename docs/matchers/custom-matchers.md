# Custom Matchers

Custom Matchers in JJ allow for extending the request matching capabilities beyond the built-in matchers. They enable the creation of highly customized conditions for matching incoming requests based on specific logic.

This documentation page is currently under development. For a practical example of how to implement and use custom matchers within JJ, please refer to the example provided in the [JJ GitHub repository](https://github.com/jj-mock/jj/tree/master/examples/custom_matcher).
